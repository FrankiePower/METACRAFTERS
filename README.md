# Project Title

Creating a token with a simple function to mint and burn tokens.

## Description

I created a simple token as the final challenge of this course. the token has basic functionalities like mint and burn. the mint function takes an address and a value and mints the "token" to the address. the balance of the token of each address is stored in a mapping . The balances increases and decreases as the mint and burn function is called. Also the burn function cannot burn a value that is higher than the balance of the token holder.
